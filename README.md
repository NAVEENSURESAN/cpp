## About

This repository contains C++ code samples, utilities, and experiments. It is ideal for learning, reference, and practicing your C++ skills. You can find examples on topics such as:

- Data structures and algorithms
- Object-oriented programming
- Templates and generic programming
- Modern C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20) features
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- File I/O and more

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NAVEENSURESAN/cpp.git
    cd cpp
    ```

2. **Build and run examples:**

    - Use your favorite C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
    - For a single file example:
